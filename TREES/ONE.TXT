trees: 
  hierichical data structure

  SOME NAME:
      1. Root Node: from where the entire tree is started.
      2. Parent Node
      3. Child Node: child of the parent node. 
      4. leaf node: node with no childern.
      5. Sibling Node: chidren of the same parent node. 
      6. Ancestors: all nodes before the node you are pointing at.
      7. Sub Tree: sub tree.

  TYPES OF BINARY TREES:
      1.Full Binary Tree = either node have 0 or 2 children but not 1.
      2.Complete Binary Tree = all levels are completly filled except the last level
                             = the last level has all the node towards as left as possible.
      3. Perfect Binary Tree = All the leaf node are at the same level.
      4. Balanced Binary Tree = Height of the tree at max should be log2(n), n = number of nodes.
      5. Degenerate Tree = Every parent have a single children.
