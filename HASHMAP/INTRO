HASHMAP: 
        MAP = a fancy box where you store pairs. (you give it key it give value)
        HASH = something that takes the key and convert it into a number (called hash code)

     WHATS HAPPENING INSIDE THE COMPUTER:
        1. A hash turns a key into a number.
        2. A map uses that number to index a contiguous bucket array.
        3. Then either follows pointers in that bucket (chaining) or probes for an empty slot (open     addressing). 
        4.
